A simple background image alternance using css only

the back div is where images hold place
there are 5 images that display one by one during 10 seconds and repeat the process infinitly
the content class is for positioning the text added
since its pure css, keyframes is the best option for animations and trasitions
so in the back div we add the "animation" property with a name (alt) and the intervale and specify the duration
and then we add the @keyframes rule with the animation name and some css style and we're done ^^
